    <h2><i>Payout Peak</i></h2>
    <p class = "greenColor">Experience a mountaineering adventure in <i>Payout Peak</i>! Collect gems to win a prize. Collect Up Arrow symbols to climb higher on the mountain. But watch out! The Rockfall symbols might take you back down the mountain. But the good news is that if you collect 4 Up Arrow or 4 Rockfall symbols, you still win a prize. Land on a cave and trigger one of two bonus games—or you might even win a prize instantly. The further you climb the mountain the higher the prizes!</p>
